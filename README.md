# Hackapine

The aim of this project is to enable Hack Clubbers using the tool Hackatime to be able to log hours spent soldering and putting together the projects they are making on Hack Clubs Hackatime system, which is used to calculate points for prizes.

Would you like to collaborate, DM David (Pixelglide) on the Hack Club slack?
